    "In school, we were introduced to the first systems of linear equations.\n",
    "In the math class at the university, we learned how to represent such systems using matrices and how to solve them systematically.\n",
    "As long as the number of equations and unknowns is manageable, these solution methods work very well.\n",
    "At this point, however, we are not concerned with determining the solution for systems with a few unknowns, but rather for systems with a large number of unknowns.\n",
    "Over the last few decades, numerical methods have been developed that can solve systems of linear equations with well over a million unknowns in a stable and efficient manner using computer programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many computational methods, such as fluid flow simulation, rely on solving systems of linear equations.\n",
    "The calculation of currents in electrical networks and of forces in mechanical structures is carried out using systems of linear equations.\n",
    "Web page evaluation by internet search engines and weather forecasting are also based on systems of linear equations.\n",
    "Efficient methods for solving systems of linear equations are also required for machine learning with artificial neural networks."
